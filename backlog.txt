If job control is in effect (see Job Control), Bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP. ????
SIGINT with valgrind in here_doc:
	==717391== Warning: noted but unhandled ioctl 0x5412 with no size/direction hints.
	==717391==    This could cause spurious value errors to appear.
	==717391==    See README_MISSING_SYSCALL_OR_IOCTL for guidance on writing a proper wrapper.

Get rid of that cd [PATH] leak
cd -> name to long error (exit 1)
cd -> check for directoies (exit 1)
cd -> permissions?

handle non-pipeable buzltins CHECK the exit code logic!
handle exit codes if return 2 to amin loop (lexer done / parser / executor)
cat << here is broken!
readline here_doc NULL check and ctrl+D same exit?
"" --> gives weird output

check multi-pipe for waitpid behavoir?
ft_export: export a should inset a= not a


Tested with tester:
0_COMPARE PARSING - DONE
	Only errors include \ that we dont need to handle

10_PARSING HELL

	Errors that include non-expansion for delimiter ($USER)

	Splitting the expanded variables

	When expansion results in a NULL string, read new input! exit_code 0

BUILTINS

	echo cd ~
